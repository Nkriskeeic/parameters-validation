_Describe the issue thoroughly. Remember that who is reading doesn't know your context._

:point_right: If it is a **bug**, then provide enough information for others to be able to **reproduce it**.

:point_right: It is okay to ask for help with your code, but keep in mind that it would be more useful
sharing and discussing your issue in more appropriated spaces such as [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

:point_right: Feature requests are welcome: explain what you want to achieve with the feature, maybe there
is another way to accomplish what you want. Remember that this is an opensource project, **Pull
Requests are welcome and encouraged**.
